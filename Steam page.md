[h1]Automating your Logistics[/h1]
[b]Welcome to Project RimFactory - Lite[/b]
This is a Stripped version of PRF - Core, and is meant to be some simple automation without too heavy on machines.
You can choose either play with this mod or with core + sub mods.
When 2.5.0 releases for core you can swap between using either one.
As they use same Def names and Assemblies.

It contain all logistic stuff from core and no machines...
 It includes:
 - Cenveyor Belts
 - Splitters
 - Pullers
 - Fueling Machine
 - Smart Hopper
 - Storage Crates
 - Wireless Storage (DSU)
 - Fridge DSU, I/O (RimFridge only)

 This is NOT compatible with core PRF as its just same mod with a lot of stuff cutout.
 you should be able to at any time update to use core instead of this.
 just disable this and enable PRF - Core instead.
 as we use same Def names across

Q: What is difference on this and Core?
A: This is a Stripped down version more meant to be a replacement of Industrial Rollers than a full automation mods.
Goes nicely with VFE - Mechanoid and such mods that have their own type of automation.

Q: What is difference between this and Industrial Rollers?
A: This is just another approuch and a newly optimized type of belts and pullers thats made to work nicely in 1.2 instead of whenever IR was first released/proper updated.

Q: Can i swap to core if i want to use that instead?
A: Yes we use same Def names so you can swap between them as you like (please wait for 2.5.0 update to drop for core though..)
