# PRF-Lite
Welcome to Project RimFactory - Lite
This is a Stripped version of PRF - Core. It features simple logistical automation without too much reliance on machines.
You can choose to either play with this mod or with core + sub mods.
When 2.5.0 releases for Core, you can swap between using either one.
As they use same Def names and Assemblies.

You can find PRF - Core here:

 ### !!! NOTE - This mod will be out before Core is updated to 2.5.0 DONT go from this mod to Core instead before prf - core updates to 2.5.0 !!!
 ## PRF - Lite is NOT compatible with other PRF versions:
  PRF - Core
  PRF - Drones
  PRF - Materials
  PRF - Insanity
  (It may be at a later point)

 The PRF - Lite version is meant to be a replacement of Industrial rollers mod (IR).
 It is a great compliment to Vanilla Faction Expanded - Mechanoids.

## Designed for optimal compatibility, this stripped-down version contain all the logistics stuff from PRF - Core without the machines.
 It has:
 - Conveyor Belts
 - Splitters
 - Pullers
 - Fueling Machines
 - Smart Hoppers
 - Storage Crates
 - Wireless Storage (DSU)
 - Fridge DSU, I/O (RimFridge only)


 This is NOT compatible with PRF - Core as it's the same mod with the machinery removed.
 You should be able to upgrade to using PRF - Core instead of this at any time by
 disabling this and enabling PRF - Core.
 
 ## Special Support for mods:
 - RimFridge - Cooled DSU/IO ports
 - Save our Ship - Building support for Refuelers (torpedo launchers)
 - Combat Extended (CE) - Added support for Refuelers (turrets)

... If any mods need special support please contact us and we can see what we can do.
