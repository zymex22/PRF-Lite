# PRF-Lite
Welcome to Project RimFactory - Lite
This is a Stripped version of PRF - Core, and is meant to be some simple automation without too heave on machines.
You can choose either play with this mod or with core+sub mods.
When 2.5.0 releases for core you can swap between using either one.
As they use same Def names and Assemblies.

You can find PRF - Core here:  
https://github.com/zymex22/Project-RimFactory-Revived  
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2033979700  

  !!! NOTE - This mod will be out before Core is updated to 2.5.0 DONT go from this mod to Core instead before prf - core updates to 2.5.0 !!!
 ## This Isnt comptaible with
  PRF - core
  PRF - Drones
  PRF - Materials
  PRF - Insanity
  (it may be at a later point)

 This is Lite version of PRF its meant to be a replacement of Industrial rollers mod (IR)
 And for use with new mod from Vanilla Faction Expanded - Mechanoid.

## It will Contain all logistic stuff from core and no machines...
 It have:
 - Cenveyor Belts
 - Splitters
 - Pullers
 - Fueling Machine
 - Smart Hopper
 - Storage Crates
 - Wireless Storage (DSU)
 - Fridge DSU, I/O (RimFridge only)


 This is NOT compatible with core PRF as its just same mod with a lot of stuff cutout.
 you should be able to at any time update to use core instead of this.
 just disable this and enable PRF - Core instead.

 as we use same Def names across
 
 ## Special Support for mods:
 - RimFridge - we use this for our cooled DSU/IO ports
 - Save our Ship - They did building support for Refuelers (torpedo launchers)
 - Combat Extended (CE) - They added support for Refuelers (turrets)
